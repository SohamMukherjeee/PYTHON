##---> it will show error, we can't use double crt under double crt;
course1='hi my name" soham' ##---> hi my name" soham
## so we can use double crt between single crt
## but if we want to use double crt between double cort then 
## we should use  \ , it's called ESCAPE SEQUENCE
course2="hi my name \" soham"  ##---> hi my name" soham
